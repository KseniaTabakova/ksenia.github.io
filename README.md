## ABOUT ME
**I am a student of BSU. I specialize in chain supply management. During my studies at the university, I was working as a marketing analyst, consulting services seller, planner of load machines. But nothing attract me in practice.**

I have always wondered how the computer appeared, how from "1" and "0" programming languages have appeared, how does computer understand my commands. Answers of familiar programmers did not satisfy me, and I began to look for answers myself for questions:

- *Book by Charles Petzold "Code. The secret language of computer Hardware and Software" turned out not enough for me, and*
- *I read the book "CCNA Routing and Switching 200-125 Official Cert Guide Library".*

### I took online programming courses of  Hi Tech Park Education Centre:
- *Java Programming Basics*
- *Basic Concept of Object Oriented Programming*
- *An Introduction to Databases*
- *The basics of algorithmization*

#### <a name="content1"></a> *...and could no longer stop.*
