# KSENIA TABAKOVA about me:
**I am a student of BSU. I specialize in chain management supplies. During my studies at the university, I worked as a marketing analyst, consulting services seller, planner of load machines. But nothing attract me in practice.**

I have always wondered how the computer appeared, how from "1" and "0" programming languages have appeared, how does computer understand my commands. Answers of familiar programmers did not satisfy me, and I began to look for answers myself
for questions.

-*Book by Charles Petzold "Code. The secret language of computer science" turned out not enough, and*
-*I studied the book â€œCCNA Routing and Switching 200-125 Official Cert Guide Library".*
